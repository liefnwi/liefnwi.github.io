## Our plans

### Education quality

LIEF aims to gradually improve the quality of education and will be committed to maintaining grading deadlines and the availability of practice exams. Our goals are making interdisciplinary education more accessible, investing in educational innovation and facilitating more permanent contracts for teachers.

### Flexibility
LIEF stands for a balanced student life. We aim to abolish unnecessary attendance requirements and advocate making all lectures available online.

### Inclusivity
Everyone should feel at home at the FNWI. That is why we want people with an unimpeded disability to be able to study and that an active diversity policy is being developed.
