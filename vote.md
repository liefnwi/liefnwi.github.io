## Our plans
This is a short overview of our plans for next year.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 10px;">
  <div><h3>Education quality</h3>First and foremost, we are here to learn. The quality of education must therefore be maintained at a high standard. Proper evaluation of teaching is crucial for this, and students are also entitled to feedback. In addition to core courses, students should have the opportunity to further develop themselves through extracurricular subjects and activities.</div>
  <div><h3>Care for student well-being</h3>Studying can be demanding. When things aren’t going so well, support should be readily accessible. That’s why student psychologists and student counsellors should also be available at Science Park. Especially in cases of study delays, the university has a supportive role to play. We also want to see greater attention paid to social safety.</div>
  <div><h3>Good facilities</h3>In order to study effectively at Science Park, the facilities must also be properly arranged. We would like to see sufficient study spaces, well-equipped teaching rooms, and an affordable canteen.</div>
  <div><h3>Strong coparticipation</h3>Students must be informed about, and have a say in, important faculty decisions.</div>
